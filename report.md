## 4. CodeAttack: Revealing Safety Generalization Challenges of Large Language Models via Code Completion

**저자:** Qibing Ren, Chang Gao, Jing Shao, Junchi Yan, Xin Tan, Wai Lam, Lizhuang Ma
**arXiv:** [2403.07865v5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07865v5)
**발행일:** 2024-03-12
**관련성 점수:** ⭐ 8.5/10

### 📝 Summary
This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that exposes a universal safety vulnerability in LLMs by transforming harmful natural language prompts into code completion tasks, successfully bypassing safety guardrails of GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 over 80% of the time. The authors demonstrate that safety alignment methods focused on natural language fail to generalize to the code domain, with larger distribution gaps between code and natural language representations leading to weaker safety generalization. The work highlights critical gaps in current safety alignment approaches and the need for robust cross-domain safety mechanisms that match LLMs' growing code capabilities.

### 🔑 Key Points
LLM safety alignment methods (RLHF, SFT) primarily focus on natural language and fail to generalize to code-domain inputs
CodeAttack transforms natural language prompts into code completion tasks, bypassing safety guardrails of GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 over 80% of the time
A larger distribution gap between code representations and natural language correlates with weaker safety generalization (e.g., encoding inputs as data structures is more effective)
The vulnerability stems from a misaligned bias where LLMs prioritize code completion behavior over safety constraints during inference
The paper analyzes potential mitigation measures and calls for more robust safety alignment that extends to code capabilities
